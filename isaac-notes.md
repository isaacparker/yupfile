 This is notes for Isaac to continue the implementation of Consay.
 
  What's Saved

  - All Phase 1 code committed to git
  - PROGRESS.md tracks what's complete
  - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md has the full roadmap
  - consay-prd.md has all requirements

  When You Return

  Just say:
  "Continue implementing Consay from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - we finished Phase 1, start Phase 2"

  Or if you want to test Phase 1 first:
  "Help me set up the database and test Phase 1"

  Quick Notes

  - .env needs real values before running (DB, auth secret, email)
  - Phase 2 is workspaces (creation, selection, switcher)
  - You can switch to Sonnet model to save cost for straightforward implementation work
  - Thinking of these names for the app: Consay.io, Yupfile.io or .co, or Gooduse.app
